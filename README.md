## SQL

### What is SQL?

SQL is a short-form of the structured query language, and it is pronounced as S-Q-L or sometimes as See-Quell.

This database language is mainly designed for maintaining the data in relational database management systems. It is a
special tool used by data professionals for handling structured data (data which is stored in the form of tables). It is
also designed for stream processing in RDSMS.

## Why SQL?

Nowadays, SQL is widely used in data science and analytics. Following are the reasons which explain why it is widely
used:

- The basic use of SQL for data professionals and SQL users is to insert, update, and delete the data from the
  relational database.
- SQL allows the data professionals and users to retrieve the data from the relational database management systems.
- It also helps them to describe the structured data.
- It allows SQL users to create, drop, and manipulate the database and its tables.
- It also helps in creating the view, stored procedure, and functions in the relational database.
- It allows you to define the data and modify that stored data in the relational database.
- It also allows SQL users to set the permissions or constraints on table columns, views, and stored procedures.
